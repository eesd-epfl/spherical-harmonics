# Spherical Harmonics

**That is the explanation that I followed to undersdant the basics:**

 - Laplaceâ€™s equation corresponds to finding the equilibrium solution (i.e. time independent solution) of the heat equation in 3D [Laplace's Equation](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/DE/LaplacesEqn.aspx)

 - Since the second derivative could be thought of as a difference of the average of two points with the one in between them. That describes how any shape deviates from the reference plane (either cartesian or spherical)

**Derivation of the Spherical Harmonics equation:**
 - [Derivation of the Laplacian from rectangular to spherical coordinates (https://planetmath.org/derivationofthelaplacianfromrectangulartosphericalcoordinates)

 - The solution to the Legendre Polynomial is presented in (Textbook: J.W. Brown, R.V. Churchill, Fourier Series and Boundary Value Problems). 

 - Binominal expansion is used in the representation of the compact Legendre Polynomial form. It is derived here: [Proof of the binomial theorem by mathematical induction](http://amsi.org.au/ESA_Senior_Years/SeniorTopic1/1c/1c_2content_6.html)
 
 - The normalisation of the associated Legendre polynomials is explored in [Normalisation of the associated Legendre polynomials](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1737301/associated-legendre-polynomials-orthogonality-proof-int-11-p-kmx-cdot)
